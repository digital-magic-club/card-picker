## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding CardPicker as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/digital-magic-club/card-picker.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
]
```

## Usage

1. Import the `CardPicker` package: `import CardPicker`
1. Create an optional `Card` variable: `@State private var card: Card?`
1. Declare a `CardPickerView` while binding your variable: `CardPickerView(card: $card)`

```
import CardPicker

struct ContentView: View {
  @State private var card: Card?

  var body: some View {
    NavigationStack {
      VStack {
        NavigationLink("Card Picker", destination: CardPickerView(card: $card))

        if let card {
          Text(card.description)
        }
      }
      .padding()
    }
  }
}
```

The magic community adoption of the DMC libraries has been amazing!
